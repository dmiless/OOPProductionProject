# OOP Production Project

This JavaFX project allows the user to input data in a GUI so that it is saved inside a database.<br />
I created this project in my Object Oriented class by myself and am releasing it's Beta version.<br />
I have been working on this project for 5 weeks and this is the Beta version after completing Sprint 2.<br />
This assignment has challenged me in using a GUI and taking the input to be used in a database.<br />
I made this as my main project for my COP 3003 class with Professor Vanselow.<br />

## Getting Started

Coming Soon <br />

## Built With

* IDE used Intellij 
* Other software used JavaFX, Gradle, Scenebuilder 
* Resources used  Connected a database to my JavaFX project and was able to obtain user input from Scenebuilder and store it in the database. 

## Contributing

I have been working on this project privately with assistiance of my professor and teach assistance to improve my knowledge.

## History

I originally had many iterations of this project on github, yet I named my orignal project incorrectly so I created a new project for the submittion of Sprint 1 (Alpha).

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized

I learned a lot about linking a database to my code to make it functional. I also learned a lot about SceneBuilder and the power that it has to create a GUI that works along side my project. 
I will continue to learn more and grow this project fully.
