# OOP Production Project

This JavaFX project is a GUI program that allows the user to input data in text fields that are then saved inside the database then produces back to the screen.<br />
I created this project in my object oriented class independently and am releasing it's Final version.<br />
I have been working on this project in COP 3003 for the Fall 2020 semester<br />
This assignment has challenged me in using a GUI and taking the input to be used in a database as well as working with a number of different classes together.<br />
This is my main production project for my object oriented course that has greatly expanded my knowledge of object oriented programming.<br />

## Getting Started

Download the most recent version of Intellij <br />
Select 'Get from version control' once Intellij starts <br />
Copy and paste this project's github URL and clone the project <br />
This should load the most recent version to edit/run <br />

## Built With

* IDE used Intellij 
* Other software used JavaFX, Gradle, Scenebuilder 
* Resources used  Connected a database to my JavaFX project and was able to obtain user input from Scenebuilder and store it in the database. 

## Contributing

I have been working on this project privately with assistiance of my professor and teach assistance to improve my knowledge.

## History
Sprint 1 (Alpha) - 9/19/20 <br />
Sprint 2 (Beta) - 10/31/20 <br />
Sprint 3 (Release) - 12/2/20 <br />
I originally had many iterations of this project on github, yet I named my orignal project incorrectly so I created a new project for the submittion of Sprint 1 (Alpha).

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized

I learned a lot about linking a database to my code to make it functional. I also learned a lot about SceneBuilder and the power that it has to create a GUI that works along side my project. This also expanded my knowledge on using many different types of classes with one another to produce one larger program.
