# OOP Production Project

This JavaFX project allows the user to input data in a GUI so that it is saved inside a database.<br />
I created this project in my Object Oriented class by myself and am releasing it's Alpha version.<br />
I have been working on this project for 5 weeks and this is the Alpha version after completing Sprint 1.<br />
This assignment has challenged me in using a GUI and taking the input to be used in a database.<br />
I made this as my first project for my COP 3003 class with Professor Vanselow.<br />

## Demonstration

Coming Soon <br />
Add an animated gif of your program running. You can use ShareX, GIPHY Capture or another tool. https://blog.github.com/2018-06-29-GIF-that-keeps-on-GIFing/
Note for school project: This is a great way for friends and family to easily see your project in action.

## Getting Started

Coming Soon <br />
Instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on someone's local machine for development and testing purposes.
<br />
Note for real project: You want to be able to share your project and enable collaboration. 
<br />
Note for school project: You want a potential client or hirer to be able to run your program. 

## Built With

* IDE used Intellij 
* Other software used JavaFX, Gradle, Scenebuilder 
* Resources used  Connected a database to my JavaFX project and was able to obtain user input from Scenebuilder and store it in the database. 

## Contributing

I have been working on this project privately with assistiance of my professor and teach assistance to improve my knowledge.

## License

Coming Soon <br />
Public repositories on GitHub are often used to share open source software. For your repository to truly be open source, you'll need to license it so that others are free to use, change, and distribute the software. https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/ <br />
You have the option to choose a license when you first create your repository. </br>
If you need to create a license for an existing repository...
1. Go to your repository.
2. Click on "Create new file" Button.
3. Type the file name as License.txt or License.md in the input box next to your repository name, a drop down button appears towards right side.
4. Choose the type of license of your choice.

## History

I originally had many iterations of this project on github, yet I named my orignal project incorrectly so I created a new project for the submittion of Sprint 1 (Alpha).

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized

I learned a lot about linking a database to my code to make it functional. I also learned a lot about SceneBuilder and the power that it has to create a GUI that works along side my project. 
I will continue to learn more and grow this project fully.
